\begin{enumerate}
	\item Type inference is possible
	\item Can be improved by analysing JSDoc or using external definitions
	\item Focus on es 6 was not possible
	\item Separate refinement from unification
	\item Hard to analyze code that depends on frameworks or events (DOM)
	\item Branch / Path sensitive analysis
\end{enumerate}
