In recent years, the popularity of JavaScript drastically increased and became a general-purpose language. However, the tool support for program verification is scarce due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, that is hard to be covered using static analysis. Existing verification tools are either limited to simple bug patterns, are based on a super or subset of JavaScript, or only support outdated JavaScript versions. This work introduces an algorithm for type inference and type checking of JavaScript code written in strict mode. This algorithm combines the Hindley-Milner Algorithm W with abstract interpretation. The type system used is unsound, as the precision of type inference diminishes for reflection-like code that is mainly found in frameworks or libraries. The defined algorithm is implemented in \textit{ESChecker} and is compared to competing type checkers. The evaluation results show that the presented type inference algorithm is precise for a majority of programs. It provides a valuable feedback to programmers if combined with type checking.
