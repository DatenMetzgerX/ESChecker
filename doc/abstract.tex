ECMAScript is the programing language of the web, nevertheless an upcoming trend is to use ECMAScript for native mobile and desktop applications or server backends, business critical applications. The tool support for catching errors early in the development lifecycle however is spare, due static analysis is non trivial for the dynamic ECMAScript language. The existing tools are either limited to find simple bug patterns, are based on a super or subset of ECMAScript or do not support the current ECMAScript version. This work describes an  algorithm for type inference and type checking ECMAScript 6 code. The defined type system is unsound but achieves good results for a majority of programs. The described algorithm is implemented in ESChecker and is to the competitive tools Flow, TAJS and infernu. The results are summarized and further techniques for improving type inference are explained.
